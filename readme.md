# A wordle clone with extra modes written in Python that can be played through terminal

This is a command-line version of NY Times' Wordle, written in Python 3.10.4 by me. It is a direct copy of the original game including some extra futures:

- Additional 6-lettered and 4-lettered modes with 7 and 5 guesses respectively
- A hard mode with lesser guesses and with 2 minutes timer.
- Official word list for 5-lettered mode to keep the original's soul.
- A leaderboard created with my own rating formula and an option to clear the leaderboard


## How to download and setup

Download the latest python version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). After that type ```` pip install -r requirements.txt```` to your terminal to download python packages that are needed for this program. I highly recommend using VSCode or Pycharm because most versions of Windows 10 does not support ANSI coloring and weird outputs like below

can happen on cmd.
